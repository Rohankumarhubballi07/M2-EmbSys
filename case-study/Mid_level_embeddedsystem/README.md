   ## Problem Statement : Detection of the fault in the power transformer.

##  Introduction:

   * Here we will use the Microcontroller embedded unit along with some sensors and 
          potentiometer to monitor the any fault in the transformer.

   *  If any fault is occurred it will be monitored and it is initiated by using a buzzer.



## Requirements

1. Low level requirements

	* Power supply to the Microcontroller unit.
	* Working of the sensors. (Both temperature sensor and oil level sensor).
	* Working of the Potentiometer (Voltage and Current).
	* Analog to digital converter
	* Relays ,buzzer and lcd.


2.	High level requirements

    * To detect any fluctuation in the temperature of the power transformer, by the temperature sensor.
    * To detect any fluctuation in the oil level of the power transformer, by the oil level sensor.
    * Any fluctuation in the voltage and current of transformer must be detected.
 
 ## Component Description:

  1. Temperature Sensor: To measure the temperature of the power transformer. 

  2. Oil level Sensor: To measure the oil level present in the power transformer.

  3. Voltage Potentiometer: Device used to measure the voltage.

  4. Current Potentiometer: Device used to measure current.

  5. Analog to Digital Converter: converts the analog form of potentiometer to digital form.

  6. Microcontroller Unit: performs all the operation to build the circuits.

  7. LCD Display: To represent the display  of the digital form.

  8. Buzzer: Indication for user if any fault occurs.

  9. Power Supply: DC voltage source required for the Microcontroller unit to build the   
                             circuit.
